Course: Gamification
Name of the game: Lyrical Type**
Some suggestion and idea that would like to share with the person that wants to work on this project would be to follow some of the design rules as you are updating the games like
1)	Keep Exclusionary Material Out of Your Game: Do not try to add more extra features. If not necessary, I got distracted and could not even complete simple functionality for the game.
2)	Randomness and Repetitiveness can be bad: This game is a very small game with not many things to explore. You are just typing. However, you can keep it engaging by adding new song and new level, creating new animation as the level changes. 
3)	As, I said before, try to implement all the buttons and their functionality in main menus and Option menu. Add Stats page, if possible, try to make a sign in page for people who wants to save the game stats data. In the main game panel, you can add health bar, some cool animation when the word is destroyed. If you are feeling spicy you can also try the same game in different language.
